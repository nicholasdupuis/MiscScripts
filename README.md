### MiscScripts

A collection of miscellaneous scripts I use while developing.

#### getbranchnames.sh

I often work on projects with nested git repositories.  While developing on feature branches on different modules, it can be easy to lose track.  When this script is run in a folder containing multiple repositories, it will print out what branch name each repository is currently on.
